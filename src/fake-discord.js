 *   `fields` are the modal's inputs by custom_id; a button press has none. `ephemeral` says that the pressed message
 *   was private (the lead's confirm), as discord.js shows it in `interaction.message.flags`. With `refuse`, every
 *   reply rejects with that error and records nothing, as Discord does for an unknown interaction (F-T27-20).
